The Email is sent via WLAN/ethernet
The server aquires the IP address of the reciever of the email (either IPv4 or IPv6) in the network to decide where the email is headed
The Email is then transported through TCP, which is slower than UDP but allows the reciever to confirm that the Email has been recieved
The reciever then uses a protocal (HTTP) to decrypt the Email
