The gamer information (player tag, character selection, weapons) is passed to the game server through WLAN/Ethernet (Probably ethernet since it has less packet loss)
Multiple IP address will be connected to the server (IPv6 or IPv4) are conneceted to the same game server, depending on how many players there are
The match info is updated via UCP, which is faster and is good for games because it reduces latency, but there is not the confirmation layer that TCP has.
