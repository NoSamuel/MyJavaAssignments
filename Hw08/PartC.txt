1) run until n is greater than or equal to 13
   output: 1 4 7 10
2) add 3 to n before printing it
   output: 4 7 10 13 (13 is included because the program stops after the number reaches 13)
3) adds one to n every loop until n reaches 3 (smaller than 4)
   output: 1 2 3
4) 3) adds one to n every loop until n reaches 4
   output: 1 2 3 4
