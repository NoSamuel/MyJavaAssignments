Ask the user for a positive integer input
If input is less than or equal to zero, then ask the user to correct their input
If input is valid, then proceed
If input is equal to one, then end program and print “One is not a prime number.”
Else, continue the program
If input % 2 = 0, then print the number is not prime.
Create a loop with variable i starting from 3 to input - 1.
If input % i = 0, then print the number is not prime,
If the loop finishes, then print the number is prime.
